# Webbit

A _nearly_ full-feature Reddit clone built with Ruby on Rails, using this project to learn a bit more about Rails.

## Modeling 

Each model will be responsible for different data throughout the app.

- User - Focused on the user.
- Submission - The user authors. Has different types (image, video, text, and link).
- Community - The category the submission belongs to.
- Comment - A response given to the submission from another user or the current user.
- Subscription - Not to be confused with billing of any type.
